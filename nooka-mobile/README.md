# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Authentication providers

Email/password, email verification, password reset and OAuth are handled by the Nooka API. Set these public build-time variables for the mobile app; do not put Facebook's app secret or any backend credential here:

```dotenv
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_WEB_CLIENT_ID=
EXPO_PUBLIC_FACEBOOK_APP_ID=
```

Google client IDs must be registered for the Android package, iOS bundle identifier and web client as applicable. Apple Sign In requires an Apple capability and the bundle identifier configured in Apple Developer; it is available on iOS only. Facebook must have the mobile redirect URI and Android/iOS platform settings configured in the Facebook app. The corresponding backend variables are documented in `../nooka-api/README.md`.

The mobile app exchanges the provider credential with `/auth/oauth/google`, `/auth/oauth/apple` or `/auth/oauth/facebook`; it never stores or sends the Facebook app secret.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
